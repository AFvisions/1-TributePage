                <li><p><b>1823</b> - Polk joins a local militia in 1822, quickly rising through the ranks to colonel. His oratory earns him the nickname "Napoleon of the Stump". He runs a successful campaign to become the new Democratic representative of Maury County in 1823.</p>

                <li><p><b>1824</b> - Polk marries Sarah Childress on January 1, 1824. Sarah fully supports her husband's political career, helping with speeches, advising on policy matters and actively campaigning with him. The couple does not have any children.</p>

                <li><p><b>1849</b> - Polk's health suffered tremendously through his presidency, not least during the Mexico war which he managed closely. He leaves office on March 4, 1849 pale, thin and exhausted. He dies in Nashville, Tennessee, on June 15, 1849, just three months later.</p>
